## Requirements

* dnadesign/silverstripe-elemental: ^4.8
* dynamic/silverstripe-geocoder: ^2.0

## Installation

`composer require dynamic/silverstripe-elemental-customer-service`

## Usage

Adds a Customer Service block to display a map, directions and contact info for your location. Userful for a Contact Us page.

### Note
In order to use the Geocoder and address map, you will need to set two [Google API keys](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key). Each key needs to have specific API libraries enabled:
* `geocoder_api_key`
    * Geocoding API
* `map_api_key`
    * Maps JavaScript API
    *  Maps Static API

They can be set in your YML file like this:

```
Dynamic\SilverStripeGeocoder\GoogleGeocoder:
  geocoder_api_key: 'your-key-here'
  map_api_key: 'your-key-here'
```
